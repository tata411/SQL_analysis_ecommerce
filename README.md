### About DATASET

This is a Brazilian ecommerce public dataset of orders made at Olist Store, the largest department store in Brazilian marketplaces (like Wildberries).
The dataset has information of 100k orders from 2016 to 2018 made at multiple marketplaces in Brazil. 
This is real commercial data, it has been anonymised, and references to the companies and partners in the review text have been replaced with the names of Game of Thrones great houses. [Link to the dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce).
